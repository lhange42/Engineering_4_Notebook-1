### Hello Python
#### Description
In this assignment, we created a simple dice rolling program.

Here is a screenshot of this program in action:

#### Lessons Learned

This assignment was pretty easy. It involved a while loop with a couple of if statements to check what the users's input was. For whatever reason, the one time I screenshot my output it happened to randomly select to print two sixes then two twos then two fours in a row.

### Calculator
#### Description
In this assignment, we created a simple calculator funciton that does different operations to the two input numbers.

#### Lessons Learned

One issue that I had when trying to code this was the "can't concatenate str and int objects" error. I realized that I was getting this error because I was trying to print both a string and an integer in the same line. I fixed this by making my doMath() function return a string instead of an int. This made the print statement contain the same type, so I no longer had an error. 
Through these assignments, I am getting better at using git commands. I finally understand when and how to add, commit, and push files which has been pretty helpful.
